# Dotfiles 
This is a mishmash of catppuccin themes that I didn't make myself + some tweaking I did do for each of them, mostly font and color changes.

## Hyprland
Hyprland setup is mostly base cachyOS setup with some small color tweaks and then some window and monitor rules for my 3 monitor setup.

## Hyprpanel
I use [hyprpanel](https://hyprpanel.com/) for the top bar, again mostly base with some font and color tweaks.

## Kitty
Kitty terminal with the official [catppuccin mocha](https://github.com/catppuccin/kitty) theme + some basic font and color changes.

## Micro
Using [micro editor](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro) for terminal work with the [catppuccin mocha theme](https://github.com/catppuccin/micro) and some color tweaks.

## Rofi
Using a tweaked version of [this catppuccin theme](https://gitlab.com/serlav/rofi-catppuccin) for rofi.

## GTK Theming
For file manager/other GTK apps I'm using the [catppuccin mocha](https://github.com/catppuccin/gtk/blob/main/docs/USAGE.md) green standard+default theme which you should be able to grab from the AUR if you're on Arch.

Theme is applied via [nwg-look](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-look) and my modified version is [here](https://github.com/rmaake1/dotfiles/tree/master/catppuccin-custom/.local/share/themes/catppuccin-custom).

Using Papirus Icons with the catppuccin theme unchanged, instructions [here](https://github.com/catppuccin/papirus-folders)

## Discord
Cleaned up and modified the [catppuccin discord theme](https://github.com/catppuccin/discord) and applied using BetterDiscord, but you should be able to drop the custom css into vencord too.

## Spotify
Using Spicetify, 'text' theme from the marketplace with a small custom css snippet to change font and hide the ascii art headers. 

## Cursor/VSCode
Not in these dots but just using base [catppuccin mocha theme](https://github.com/catppuccin/vscode) and [icon pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Catppuccin.catppuccin-vsc-icons)

## Browser
Using [catppuccin mocha chrome theme](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/catppuccin-chrome-theme-m/bkkmolkhemgaeaeggcmfbghljjjoofoh)

## Wallpapers
Wallpapers were all pulled from [this repo](https://github.com/orangci/walls-catppuccin-mocha)

Using [hyprpaper](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Hypr-Ecosystem/hyprpaper/) with a small [script](https://github.com/rmaake1/dotfiles/blob/master/hypr/.config/hypr/scripts/wallpapers.sh) that changes to a random wallpaper across all monitors once every 5 minutes.
